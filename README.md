# generate-usernames

Working on Penetration Testing lab, I found myself repeating the same tasks, which is why I decide to automate this process.
While performing bruteforce attack, I have to manually generate login usernames in different formats (FirstnameLastname, LastnameFirstName, FLastname, LFirstname, etc.) Becasue of this, I decide to write a small script to generate usernames, adding to my toolkit for penetration testing.
